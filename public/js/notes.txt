// the main bug was that sometimes I would get duplicated get requests to twitter


// time zero is the start time
// 


// ability to comment on tweets and highlight tweets




// reverse the flow
  // can i get the height of the new div without




// take tweets wider
// make them centered
// put time divider at bottom of each time segment div



// fix jump to end..


// node.scrollTop()
// gives distance from the top...

// i know the current tweet by id...
// i can always calc the date/time to get the class.. write a f'n for that...

// if moving up and bottom 
  // then move to next

// offset gives {top:, left:}

// can calc the .tweets top and bottom positions and know when the top of bottom
// of the current div peeks over
// or which div contains the midline of tweets

// and then f'n that based on a tweet num, jumps to that in the graph..
